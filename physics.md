Here’s a realistic, progressive plan to get **IB Physics HL-ready** (or even SL if you decide later) while you’re still in Year 8. You have 4 full years — that’s enough time to arrive in Year 12 treating IB Physics HL like a review rather than a struggle.

### Phase 1: Year 8–9 (Build rock-solid foundations + intuition)
Goal: Finish everything your school will teach you in Years 10–11 *before* Year 10 even starts.

1. **Cambridge Lower Secondary Science / IGCSE Physics early**
   - Book: **Complete Physics for Cambridge IGCSE (3rd or 4th edition)** by Stephen Pople (Oxford) – read + do every single question
   - Or the free Save My Exams / Physics and Maths Tutor topic notes + questions (GCSE & iGCSE level)

2. **Fun conceptual start (watch in parallel)**
   - MinutePhysics, Veritasium, Physics Girl, Vsauce (YouTube)
   - Book: **Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!** + **Six Easy Pieces** by Richard Feynman (readable at your age, makes you fall in love with physics)

3. **Khan Academy**
   - Finish all of Physics (1-D motion → electricity → waves → basic modern physics) + AP Physics 1 collection

4. **Practical skills**
   - Start playing with PhET simulations (phet.colorado.edu) – every single simulation in the Physics section

### Phase 2: Year 10 (Finish pre-IB content + start real IB topics early)
By the end of Year 10 you want to have already covered 90% of IB Physics SL and 60–70% of HL.

5. **Main textbook sequence (get these now and work through slowly)**
   Start with:
   - **Oxford IB Diploma Physics Course Companion** (2023 syllabus) – best explanations
   - **Pearson (Tsokos) Physics for the IB Diploma** (7th edition, 2023 syllabus) – slightly harder questions
   - **K.A.Tsokos HL Option books** later (especially D: Astrophysics or C: Imaging if you love them)

6. **Question practice**
   - Physics and Maths Tutor (PMT) – all iGCSE + A-Level questions sorted by topic (free)
   - Save My Exams topic questions (free tier is enough at the start)

7. **YouTube channels that follow the 2023 IB syllabus exactly**
   - **Chris Doner Physics** – best IB-specific channel, topic-by-topic videos + worked solutions
   - **Mitch Campbell** – excellent HL extensions and Option topics
   - **Flipping Physics** (AP style but covers almost everything IB does)

### Phase 3: Year 11 (Full IB syllabus + start past papers)
8. **Revision Village Physics** (same platform as for Math – gold standard)
   - Thousands of IB-specific questions (easy/medium/hard)
   - Video solutions + mock exams

9. **Past Papers**
   - Start doing full Paper 1 + Paper 2 from 2016–2023 (old syllabus still 85–90% useful)
   - From 2023 onward: new syllabus papers (N23, M24, N24, M25 etc.)
   - Get them from ibresources.org or your school’s questionbank

10. **HL-only topics (do these in Year 11)**
    - Wave phenomena (double-slit, Doppler, standing waves)
    - Electromagnetic induction + fields
    - Quantum & nuclear physics (including Schrödinger, tunneling – very mathy)
    - Option topic of your choice (Relativity or Engineering Physics are the hardest/most impressive)

### Phase 4: Year 12 (Exam mastery)
- Revision Village predicted papers + timed mocks
- Internal Assessment (IA) – start experimenting early! (10% of final grade but huge differentiator for 7s)

### Suggested Aggressive Timeline
| Year   | Milestone                                                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Year 8 | Finish GCSE/IGCSE Physics + Khan Academy Physics                          |
| Year 9 | Finish Oxford IB book SL sections + basic HL topics (mechanics, waves)   |
| Year 10| Complete entire IB SL syllabus + 70% of HL + start past Paper 1 & 2      |
| Year 11| Full HL syllabus + 50+ past papers + start Revision Village hard questions|
| Year 12| Mocks, predicted papers, IA 24/24 → 7 guaranteed                         |

### Competitions (optional but amazing for physics lovers)
- British Physics Olympiad Round 1 (Year 11–13, but you can try early)
- Physics Bowl (online)
- PAT (Oxford entrance paper) practice in Year 12 – way harder than IB HL

Start this week with the Oxford IGCSE Physics book or Khan Academy Physics. You’ll be so far ahead by Year 11 that IB Physics HL will feel easy.

Which route are you more likely to take in Year 12 — Physics HL or SL? (So I can fine-tune the depth.)
