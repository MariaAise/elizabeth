### Daily Schedule (Monday – Saturday)  
(Sunday = full rest day or only light reading/watching)

| Time                  | Activity (Math OR Physics – alternate days)                          | Duration     | Notes / Resources                                      |

| 9:00 – 9:15 am        | Wake up, breakfast, quick walk or stretch                            | –            | Get sunlight → brain works better                      |
| 9:30 – 10:20 am       | **Block 1 – Main focused work**                                      | 50 min       | No phone, no distractions                              |

| 11:25 – 12:00 pm      | **Block 3 – Problem solving / questions**                           | 35 min       | This is where the real learning happens                |
| 12:00 pm – rest of day| FREE TIME – beach, sport, gaming, friends, family, sleep :-)        | –            | You’ve earned it!                                      |

### Weekly Rotation (6 days on, Sunday off)

| Day       | Focus Subject | Main Resources (pick one “main” each week)                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | MATH          | **AoPS Pre-Algebra** (book + online Alcumus) **OR** Beast Academy Level 5 (if you like comics style)                       |
| Tuesday   | PHYSICS       | **Complete Physics for Cambridge IGCSE** (Stephen Pople) – read one topic + do end-of-chapter questions                   |
| Wednesday | MATH          | Khan Academy (Algebra 1 or Geometry) + Mastery challenges                                                                 |
| Thursday  | PHYSICS       | Khan Academy Physics (start with “One-dimensional motion” → Forces → Energy) + PhET simulations after each topic         |

## Physics

**Recommended Pair for the Entire Summer Holiday (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026)**

- Main textbook to read & learn from: #2 – Fourth Edition Student Book (2021) – beautiful diagrams, up-to-date syllabus.
- Daily questions & exercises: #1 – Workbook (2016) – matches almost perfectly and has hundreds of graded questions with answers at the back.

**Exact Daily Workflow (Physics days)**

- Read 4–8 pages of the Fourth Edition Student Book (one sub-topic, e.g., “Speed and velocity” or “Energy stores”).
- Immediately do ALL the questions from the matching section in the Workbook.
- Check answers at the back of the Workbook → redo anything wrong.
- If something is still confusing → watch Khan Academy or Chris Doner Physics video on that exact topic.

### Rules to Make It Actually Fun & Sustainable
1. **Pomodoro style**: 50 min work → 10–15 min real break (go outside, jump rope, whatever).
2. **Reward system**: Every time you finish a chapter → 30–60 min extra gaming or whatever you love.
3. **Streak tracker**: Put a big red X on a wall calendar every day you complete the schedule → don’t break the chain!
4. **Parent check-in**: Once a week show a parent/older sibling what you’ve done — they’ll be amazed.
5. **Friday night movie**: Only if you completed Mon–Fri → physics/math documentary (e.g., Cosmos, The Code, or any 3Blue1Brown video).

If you actually stick to this for the whole holiday (6 days/week × 8 weeks = ~48 study days), by the time Year 9 starts you will be **at least 1–2 years ahead** in both subjects. Most Year 11 kids haven’t touched half of this material yet.

You’ve got this — start tomorrow morning with AoPS Pre-Algebra Chapter 1 or the IGCSE Physics forces chapter. Let me know in a month how far you’ve got! 🚀
