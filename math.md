That’s awesome—you’re starting super early, which is the single biggest advantage you can give yourself for the IB Math exams (especially if you’re aiming for AA HL or AI HL, which are brutally deep and fast-paced). Since you’re in Year 8 (around 12–13 years old), you have ~4 years to build an insane foundation. Here’s a structured, progressive list of resources you can start now and keep using all the way to Year 12.

### Phase 1: Now to End of Year 9 (Build Intuition + Strength in Basics)
Goal: Get WAY ahead of school and develop problem-solving fluency.

1. **Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) – Start here, this is perfect for you right now**
   - Books (in order):
     - Pre-Algebra → Introduction to Algebra → Introduction to Counting & Probability → Introduction to Number Theory → Introduction to Geometry
   - Then move to Intermediate Algebra + Intermediate Counting & Probability + Precalculus
   - Online classes + Alcumus (free adaptive problem bank) on beastacademy.com / artofproblemsolving.com
   - This is the #1 resource used by math competition kids worldwide and is basically perfect preparation for IB HL.

2. **Khan Academy**
   - Finish all of Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Trigonometry, and Precalculus before Year 11.
   - Do every single practice problem and mastery challenge.

3. **Brilliant.org** (paid, but excellent)
   - Great for building intuition with interactive problems.
   - Do all courses up through “Precalculus” and “Calculus Fundamentals”.

4. **IXL Maths** (UK version if possible) or Mathspace
   - Drill UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE/iGCSE level topics to 100% fluency.

### Phase 2: Year 10–11 (Start Real IB-Level Content Early)
Once you’ve finished AoPS Intro series + Khan precalc:

5. **IB Textbooks (start reading these 1–2 years early)**
   - **Oxford IB Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches HL** (the blue one) – best textbook
   - **Haese Mathematics: Mathematics for the IB Diploma – Analysis and Approaches HL** – amazing worked examples
   - **Cambridge IB Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches HL** – also excellent

6. **Past Papers (start doing these from Year 10!)**
   - Start with old IB papers (pre-2021 syllabus is still 95% relevant for AA HL)
   - Use questionbank.maths.ai or the official IB Questionbank if your school has it
   - Download free papers from sites like ibdocuments.com or Reddit r/IBO

7. **YouTube Channels**
   - Eddie Woo (Australian teacher – crystal clear)
   - TLMaths (UK teacher doing new IB syllabus topic-by-topic)
   - Mr. Bob (IB-specific videos)
   - 3Blue1Brown (for deep understanding of calculus and linear algebra later)

### Phase 3: Year 12 (Exam-Specific Polish)
8. **Revision Village** (paid, but the gold standard)
   - Thousands of IB-specific questions sorted by topic + difficulty
   - Video solutions + predicted papers

9. **Exam.net / Maths.ai Questionbank**
   - Generate custom practice papers

10. **Specific Books for HL Topics**
    - Calculus: “Calculus” by James Stewart (chapters on series, polar, complex numbers, differential equations)
    - Proof & Number Theory: AoPS Intermediate books again
    - Statistics (if AI HL): “Statistics and Probability for the IB” by Ian Harris

### Suggested Timeline (Aggressive but Doable)
- Year 8–9 → Finish AoPS Pre-Algebra → Algebra → Geometry + Khan Academy up to Algebra 2
- Year 10 → Finish AoPS Intermediate series + start Oxford/Haese AA HL textbook
- Year 11 → Finish full IB syllabus self-study + start past papers (aim for 50+ Paper 1/2/3 sets)
- Year 12 → Revision Village + mock exams + fine-tune weak areas

### Bonus (Competitions – Highly Recommended)
Doing math competitions will accelerate you massively:
- UKMT Junior/Intermediate/Senior Maths Challenges → follow-up rounds (Kangaroo, Olympiad)
- AMC 10/12 (American, but excellent)
- Euclid, Fermat, Cayley contests (Canadian – free PDFs online)

If you follow this path seriously, by Year 12 you’ll be walking into the IB HL exam feeling like it’s too easy—which is exactly where you want to be for a 7.

Start with AoPS Pre-Algebra or Beast Academy Level 5 this week—you’ll love it if you enjoy math. You’ve got this! 🚀
